                    No matter how you approach social media management, whether with the help of an agency or a toolset,
                    it’s essential to understand more than social media management’s definition. You want to know what
                    it includes, as well as how to make it a success for your company.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-left"> What is social media management? </h3>
                <p>
                    Social media management is the process of creating, publishing, and analyzing content you post on
                    social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, as well as engaging with users on
                    those platforms. You can streamline social media management with free and paid tools, as well as
                    professional social media management services.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-left"> What is a social media manager? </h3>
                <p>
                    A social media manager, whether working as a consultant, in-house employee, or team member at a
                    social media agency, is a skilled professional at social media marketing, advertising, and
                    management. They help achieve your goals for social media, like growing your following or social
                    media revenue.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-left"> Why practice social media management? </h3>
                <p>
                    Social media management offers several benefits, including:

                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Cost:</strong> No matter your marketing budget, social media is a cost-effective
                        initiative.
                        It’s free to
                        join social media networks, post content, respond to user comments, and more. Even advertising
                        offers a profitable channel for reaching your audience and building an online following.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Reach:</strong> Social media networks, from Facebook to LinkedIn, can connect you with
                        users across the world. You can also use social media platforms, like Pinterest, to reach niche
                        audiences. Traditional marketing and advertising can’t match the reach — or price — or social.
                        That’s why social media management is a must for businesses.</li>
                    <li> <strong> Users: </strong>
                        Incorporating social media into your marketing strategy allows you to align your marketing
                        initiatives with user behavior. For example, 74% of people now use social media when making
                        purchase decisions. Not to mention, 80% of people get advice about a purchase through social
                        media.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong> Performance: </strong> Marketers and business owners alike agree on the performance of social media
                        marketing and advertising. Via social, companies can build their brand and even generate leads
                        and sales. Almost 45% of business-to-business (B2B) marketers, for instance, have earned a
                        client through Facebook.</li>
                </ul>
